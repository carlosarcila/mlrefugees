# Predicting refugee integration using machine learning and synthetic populations
A tool capable of estimating the future social integration of refugees and asylum seekers in all basic regions of Europe (NUTS 2) is presented, based on supervised machine learning and synthetic populations.

For this, data from public opinion surveys (specifically 5 Eurobarometers between 2015 and 2017) on attitudes towards refugees and asylum seekers were modeled using machine learning algorithms, to estimate the individual probability of supporting refugees. 
Subsequently, simulation was used to build synthetic populations (artificial populations) based on Eurostat census data (at the NUTS2 level) throughout Europe, to estimate the aggregate probabilities for each geographic region. 
Specifically, the sociodemographic characteristics of 2,710,000 European citizens were simulated, corresponding to 10,000 in each of the 271 NUTS2.

Here the Jupyter Notebooks for the generated synthetic populations and predictive models are provided, in addition to a longitudinal query database.

Finally, interactive visualization maps, including comparative analysis between models, countries and regions, as well as longitudinal analysis of survey periods, are available at the following link:
